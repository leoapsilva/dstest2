# Data Structure Test #2 

## Problem statement
We would like to build a data tree where the parent node can count how many children its on lower levels.
Write a class User following the recommendations above:

1. Extendend from Model class
2. The root node knows how many nodes are directly or indirected linked to it, considering all the level: ```method getChildrenCount()```
3. A node knows only the numeber of children direclty linked to it: ```method getChildrenCount()```
4. Any node knows its parent: ```method parent()```
5. Any node knows its children: ```method getChildren()```
