# Data Structure Test #2 

## Problem statement
We would like to build a data tree where the parent node can count how many children its on lower levels.
Write a class User following the recommendations above:

1. Extendend from Model class
2. The root node knows how many nodes are directly or indirected linked to it, considering all the level: ```method getChildrenCount()```
3. A node knows only the numeber of children direclty linked to it: ```method getChildrenCount()```
4. Any node knows its parent: ```method parent()```
5. Any node knows its children: ```method getChildren()```

## Proposed solution


## Questions to validate
- [#2 Validate the expected behavior when a node is removed: remove the branch or only the node an keep its children?](https://github.com/leoapsilva/dstest2/issues/2)
- [#3 Validate what is the unique key of a node](https://github.com/leoapsilva/dstest2/issues/3)

# Bugs found
- [#4 After removing a node on test example C the children count is wrong] (https://github.com/leoapsilva/dstest2/issues/4)
